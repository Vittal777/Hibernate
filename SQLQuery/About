SQL Queries in Hibernate is known as Native Queries
NativeQuery is an interface which gives createNativeQuery() method fro creating sql queries.
we should use addEntity() to specify the entity type to which the query results should b mapped
There's no need to use addEntity() when we aren't returning any rows but only aggregates like count,sum etc...
