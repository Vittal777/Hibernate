There are 3 stages in hibernate objects life
Transient,Persistent,Detach
objects will enter transient state when they're created...i.e, at 'new' keyword.
Then,the objects will go to persistent state when we set values and save them with session.persist(object)
In persistent state..although we change the values it will automatically sync to database.
Also..we shouldn't run and try again with same values which is a primary key.
After the object is detached with session.evict(object)..changes made wont sync to the database
