GET vs LOAD
The get method is used to retrieve an object by its primary key.
If the object with the specified primary key exists in the database, get returns the actual object.
If the object is not found in the database, get returns null.(returned NullPointerException in my case)

load method also retrieves an object by its primary key.
load returns a proxy object (a placeholder) without hitting the database immediately. The actual database query is deferred until the proxy is accessed.
If the object is not found in the database, invoking methods on the proxy may result in a ObjectNotFoundException.
load is useful when you need to initialize an object lazily and don't need its data immediately.
