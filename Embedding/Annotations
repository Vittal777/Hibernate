@Embeddable : to annotate a class whose instances are embedded as components within other entity classes.
Like in given code...Productprop class is given @Embeddable annotaion on top of it making it embed in Product class.
The properties of the class annotated with @Embeddable are mapped directly to the columns of the table containing the owning entity.

@Embedded : to embed an @Embeddable class within an entity class.
Like in Product class...we intialized private Productprop props;
Since Productprops isn't a default datatype like int,String etc...we should instruct that Productprop class want to embed in Product class.
Soo...we use @Embedded annotation on top of it.
